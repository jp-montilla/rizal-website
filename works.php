Saturnina is a loving sister who always cared about Jose, she took care of him while their mother was imprisoned, and she always contribute to his educational expenses.

Vicente Balaguer requested Rizal to paint a beautiful backdrop for the church altar that would show a colonnaded court, seen from a wide-open gate like that of a scene depicting the court of Pontius Pilate. Along with two other painters, Jose finished this difficult task. The painting is now unavailable because it was destroyed during the second world war.</p>

                                      <p class="description">Juan Crisostomo Ibarra is a young Filipino who, after studying for seven years in Europe, returns to his native land to find that his father, a wealthy landowner, has died in prison as the result of a quarrel with the parish curate, a Franciscan friar named Padre Damaso. Ibarra is engaged to a beautiful and accomplished girl, Maria Clara, the supposed daughter and only child of the rich Don Santiago de los Santos, commonly known as “Capitan Tiago.”<br/><br/>
                                      Ibarra resolves to forego all quarrels and to work for the betterment of his people. To show his good intentions, he seeks to establish, at his own expense, a public school in his native town. He meets with ostensible support from all, especially Padre Damaso’s successor, a young and gloomy Franciscan named Padre Salvi, for whom Maria Clara confesses to an instinctive dread.
                                      At the laying of the cornerstone for the new schoolhouse, a suspicious accident, apparently aimed at Ibarra’s life, occurs, but the festivities proceed until the dinner, where Ibarra is grossly and wantonly insulted over the memory of his father by Fray Damaso. The young man loses control of himself and is about to kill the friar, who is saved by the intervention of Maria Clara.
                                      Ibarra is excommunicated, and Capitan Tiago, through his fear of the friars, is forced to break the engagement and agree to the marriage of Maria Clara with a young and inoffensive Spaniard provided by Padre Damaso. Obedient to her reputed father’s command and influenced by her mysterious dread of Padre Salvi, Maria Clara consents to this arrangement, but becomes seriously ill, only to be saved by medicines sent secretly by Ibarra and clandestinely administered by a girl friend.
                                      Ibarra succeeds in having the excommunication removed, but before he can explain matters, an uprising against the Civil Guard is secretly brought about through agents of Padre Salvi, and the leadership is ascribed to Ibarra to ruin him. He is warned by a mysterious friend, an outlaw called Elias, whose life he had accidentally saved; but desiring first to see Maria Clara, he refuses to make his escape, and when the outbreak page occurs, he is arrested as the instigator of it and thrown into prison in Manila.
                                      On the evening when Capitan Tiago gives a ball in his Manila house to celebrate his supposed daughter’s engagement, Ibarra makes his escape from prison and succeeds in seeing Maria Clara alone. He begins to reproach her because it is a letter written to her before he went to Europe which forms the basis of the charge against him, but she clears herself of treachery to him. The letter had been secured from her by false representations and in exchange for two others written by her mother just before her birth, which prove that Padre Damaso is her real father. These letters had been accidentally discovered in the convento by Padre Salvi, who made use of them to intimidate the girl and get possession of Ibarra’s letter, from which he forged others to incriminate the young man. She tells him that she will marry the young Spaniard, sacrificing herself thus to save her mother’s name and Capitan Tiago’s honor and to prevent a public scandal, but that she will always remain true to him.
                                      Ibarra’s escape had been effected by Elias, who conveys him in a banka up the Pasig to the Lake, where they are so closely beset by the Civil Guard that Elias leaps into the water and draws the pursuers away from the boat, in which Ibarra lies concealed.
                                      On Christmas Eve, at the tomb of the Ibarras in a gloomy wood, Elias appears, wounded and dying, to find there a boy named Basilio beside the corpse of his mother, a poor woman who had been driven to insanity by her husband’s neglect and abuses on the part of the Civil Guard, her younger son having page disappeared some time before in the convento, where he was a sacristan. Basilio, who is ignorant of Elias’s identity, helps him to build a funeral pyre, on which his corpse and the madwoman’s are to be burned.
                                      Upon learning of the reported death of Ibarra in the chase on the Lake, Maria Clara becomes disconsolate and begs her supposed godfather, Fray Damaso, to put her in a nunnery. Unconscious of her knowledge of their true relationship, the friar breaks down and confesses that all the trouble he has stirred up with the Ibarras has been to prevent her from marrying a native, which would condemn her and her children to the oppressed and enslaved class. He finally yields to her entreaties and she enters the nunnery of St. Clara, to which Padre Salvi is soon assigned in a ministerial capacity.

                                      <h3 class="title">El Filibusterismo</h3>
                                      <p class="description">Crisostomo Ibarra is back and as Simoun. During the period in between the story line of Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo which is 13 years, Ibarra left the Philippines and became a wealthy jeweler. He came back to the Philippines as Senor Simoun, disguised with a beard. He seems to have long abandoned his once vision of ending the despotism of Spain with words and peace. He becomes hungry for vengeance for all the misfortune our country has suffered under the tyranny of the Spaniards . And near the end of the novel, when he discovers that his lover, Maria Clara, died in the convent, he becomes all the more furious. Simoun is a confidant of the Captain-General. He encourages the government to make bad decisions and to abuse their power so that it would spark a revolution among the masses. Basilio, now all grown up, is at first reluctant to join in on Simoun’s idea but ends up being part of the plan. Simoun started planning uprisings and stashed guns in the shop of an ally. At the wedding reception of newlyweds (the bride being the ex-girlfriend of one of the friends of Basillo—Isagani), Simoun tells Basilio that his plan was to conceal an explosive which contains nitroglycerin inside a pomegranate-styled Kerosene lamp that Simoun will give to the newlyweds as a gift during the wedding reception. The reception will take place at the former home of the late Captain Tiago, which was now filled with explosives planted by Simoun. According to Simoun, the lamp will stay lighted for only 20 minutes before it flickers; if someone attempts to turn the wick, it will explode and kill everyone—important members of civil society and the Church hierarchy—inside the house. Simoun leaves the reception early and leaves a note with the words: “Mene Thecel Phares” which means “the future is predetermined” and is generally implied that a bad event is going to happen. Simoun signed it with his real name “Juan Crisostomo Ibarra”. The people at the reception were shocked because Ibarra is supposedly dead. One of the priests who knew Ibarra before the ending of Noli Me Tangere confirmed to the people that it was the writing of Ibarra. The lamp started to dim. Outside the house, Basilio was about to walk away because he knew the lamp was going to explode anytime soon when he saw Isagani, the still heart-broken ex-boyfriend of the bride whose reception was still going on in the house of Capitan Tiago. Isagani said that he just wanted to congratulate the newly-weds. Basilio who then feared for the safety of his friend told him about the plan of Simoun. Isagani ran to the house. A priest was about to fix the lamp but once Isagani got in, he found the lamp and threw it out the window into the river outside the residence. Since the guards were chasing Isagani, he himself jumped out of the window into the river as well. There was an uprising planned by Simoun during the time of the reception. The band got caught and confessed that Simoun lead them. Ibarra was now wanted both as himself and as Simoun. Days passed and a good priest found Simoun walking along the shore, wounded and weak. The noble priest tended to Simoun while the latter explained that he is Ibarra and that he was greatly saddened and angry due to the failure of the revolution and that he was questioning God as to why he was the one who is suffering and not the ones who have forsaken the people of the Philippines. The priest explains that all punishments will come in due time. Ibarra died as he weakly held the hand of the priest. The latter blessed the former and threw away all the remaining jewels of Ibarra in the hopes that they may always be used for good.</p>
