                                <p class="description">The seventh child of Francisco Rizal Mercado and Teodora Alonzo y Quintos. The Mercado family were wealthy farmers who rented land from the Dominican religious order. Descendants of a Chinese immigrant named Domingo Lam-co, they changed their name to Mercado under the pressure of anti-Chinese feeling among the Spanish colonizers.</p>
                                <p class="description">From an early age, Jose Rizal Mercado showed a precocious intellect. He learned the alphabet from his mother at the age of three and could read and write at age five.</p>
                                <p class="description">The period when the following values and virtues were developed in him: industriousness, creativeness, rationality, and dignity.</p>

                                <h3 class="title">SECOND PERIOD</h3>
                                <p class="description">José Rizal Mercado attended the Ateneo Municipal de Manila at the age of 11, graduating at the age of 16 with highest honors. He took a post-graduate course there in land surveying.</p>
                                <p class="description">It was the period when Frs. Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora were unjustly executed by the Spanish government. Their martyrdom led Rizal to be awakened to the abuses of the regime and at the same time led him to devote himself in the future to avenge the victims of injustices and cruelties of the Spanish colonizers.</p>
                                <p class="description">Rizal Mercado completed his surveyor's training in 1877, and passed the licensing exam in May 1878, but could not receive a license to practice because he was only 17 years old. (He was granted a license in 1881 when he reached the age of majority.)</p>
                                <p class="description">In 1878, the young man also enrolled in the University of Santo Tomas as a medical student. He later quit the school, alleging discrimination against Filipino students by the Dominican professors.</p>

                                <h3 class="title">THIRD PERIOD</h3>
                                <p class="description">In May of 1882, José Rizal got on a ship to Spain without informing his parents of his intentions. He enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid. In June of 1884, he received his medical degree at the age of 23; the following year, he also graduated from the Philosophy and Letters department.</p>
                                <p class="description">Inspired by his mother's advancing blindness, Rizal next went to the University of Paris and then the University of Heidelberg to complete further study in the field of ophthalmology. At Heidelberg, he studied under the famed professor Otto Becker. Rizal finished his second doctorate at Heidelberg in 1887.</p>
                                <p class="description">Jose Rizal lived in Europe for 10 years. During that time, he picked up a number of languages; in fact, he could converse in more than 10 different tongues. While in Europe, the young Filipino impressed everyone who met him with his charm, his intelligence, and his mastery of an incredible range of different fields of study. Rizal excelled at martial arts, fencing, sculpture, painting, teaching, anthropology, and journalism, among other things.</p>
                                <p class="description">During his European sojourn, he also began to write novels. Rizal finished his first book, Noli Me Tangere, while living in Wilhemsfeld with the Reverend Karl Ullmer.</p>
                                <p class="description">Rizal wrote Noli Me Tangere in Spanish; it was published in 1887 in Berlin. The novel is a scathing indictment of the Catholic Church and Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines, and its publication cemented Jose Rizal's position on the Spanish colonial government's list of troublemakers. When Rizal returned home for a visit, he received a summons from the Governor General and had to defend himself from charges of disseminating subversive ideas.</p>
                                <p class="description">Although the Spanish governor accepted Rizal's explanations, the Catholic Church was less willing to forgive. In 1891, Rizal published a sequel, titled El Filibusterismo.</p>
                                <p class="description">Both in his novels and in newspaper editorials, Jose Rizal called for a number of reforms of the Spanish colonial system in the Philippines. He advocated freedom of speech and assembly, equal rights before the law for Filipinos, and Filipino priests in place of the often-corrupt Spanish churchmen. In addition, Rizal called for the Philippines to become a province of Spain, with representation in the Spanish legislature (the Cortes Generales).</p>
                                <p class="description">Rizal never called for independence for the Philippines. Nonetheless, the colonial government considered him a dangerous radical and declared him an enemy of the state.</p>

                                <h3 class="title">FOURTH PERIOD</h3>
                                <p class="description">In 1892, Rizal returned to the Philippines. He was almost immediately accused of being involved in the brewing rebellion and was exiled to Dapitan City, on the island of Mindanao. Rizal would stay there for four years, teaching school and encouraging agricultural reforms.</p>
                                <p class="description">During that same period, the people of the Philippines grew more eager to revolt against the Spanish colonial presence. Inspired in part by Rizal's organization, La Liga, rebel leaders like Andres Bonifacio began to press for military action against the Spanish regime.</p>
                                <p class="description">In Dapitan, Rizal met and fell in love with Josephine Bracken, who brought her stepfather to him for a cataract operation. The couple applied for a marriage license but were denied by the Church (which had excommunicated Rizal).</p>
                                <p class="description">The Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896. Rizal denounced the violence and received permission to travel to Cuba in order to tend victims of yellow fever in exchange for his freedom. Bonifacio and two associates sneaked aboard the ship to Cuba before it left the Philippines, trying to convince Rizal to escape with them, but Rizal refused.</p>
                                <p class="description">He was arrested by the Spanish on the way, taken to Barcelona, and then extradited to Manila for trial. José Rizal was tried by court-martial, charged with conspiracy, sedition, and rebellion. Despite a lack of any evidence of his complicity in the Revolution, Rizal was convicted on all counts and given the death sentence.</p>
                                <p class="description">He was allowed to marry Josephine two hours before his execution by firing squad on December 30, 1896. Jose Rizal was just 35 years old.</p>

        <div data-aos="fade-left">
          <p>The Rizals is considered one of the biggest families during their time. Domingo Lam-co, the family's paternal ascendant was a full-blooded Chinese who came to the Philippines from Amoy, China in the closing years of the 17th century and married a Chinese half-breed by the name of Ines de la Rosa.</p>
          <p>Researchers revealed that the Mercado-Rizal family had also traces of Japanese, Spanish, Malay and Even Negrito blood aside from Chinese.</p>
          <p>Jose Rizal came from a 13-member family consisting of his parents, Francisco Mercado II and Teodora Alonso Realonda, and nine sisters and one brother.</p>

                  <p>His sweetheart for 11 years played the greatest influence in keeping him from falling in love with other women during his travel.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, Leonor’s mother disapproved of her daughter’s relationship with Rizal, who was then a known filibustero. She hid from Leonor all letters sent to her sweetheart. Leonor believing that Rizal had already forgotten her, sadly consented her to marry the Englishman Henry Kipping, her mother’s choice.</p>

                  <p>The prettiest of Don Pablo Ortiga’s daughters, fell in love with Rizal. He dedicated to her A la Senorita C.O. y R., which became one of his best poems.</p>
                  <p>The Ortiga's residence in Madrid was frequented by Rizal and his compatriots. He probably fell in love with her and Consuelo apparently asked him for romantic verses. He suddenly backed out before the relationship turned into a serious romance, because he wanted to remain loyal to Leonor Rivera and he did not want to destroy hid friendship with Eduardo de Lete who was madly in love with Consuelo.</p>

                  <p>While Rizal was in London annotating the Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, he boarded in the house of the Beckett family, within walking distance of the British Museum. Gertrude, a blue-eyed and buxom girl was the oldest of the three Beckett daughters. She fell in love with Rizal. </p>
                  <p>Tottie helped him in his painting and sculpture. But Rizal suddenly left London for Paris to avoid Gertrude, who was seriously in love with him. Before leaving London, he was able to finish the group carving of the Beckett sisters. He gave the group carving to Gertrude as a sign of their brief relationship.</p>

                  <p>Rizal having lost Leonor Rivera, entertained the thought of courting other ladies. While a guest of the Boustead family at their residence in the resort city of Biarritz, he had befriended the two pretty daughters of his host, Eduardo Boustead. Rizal used to fence with the sisters at the studio of Juan Luna.

                  <p>- In 1890, Rizal moved to Brussels because of the high cost of living in Paris. In Brussels, he lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters.</p>
                  <p>In time, they fell deeply in love with each other. Suzanne cried when Rizal left Brussels and wrote him when he was in Madrid.</p>

                  <p>In the last days of February 1895, while still in Dapitan, Rizal met an 18-year old petite Irish girl, with bold blue eyes, brown hair and a happy disposition. She was Josephine Bracken, the adopted daughter of George Taufer from Hong Kong, who came to Dapitan to seek Rizal for eye treatment. Rizal was physically attracted to her. His loneliness and boredom must have taken the measure of him and what could be a better diversion that to fall in love again. But the Rizal sisters suspected Josephine as an agent of the friars and they considered her as a threat to Rizal’s security</p>
